# python-phonelookup
A simple python script to look up public details about a US phone number using the Twilio API

This uses the Twilio (and others available on it such as Icehook Scout, and Nomorobo) APIs. You MUST have a Twilio API key to use this.

You may also have to install ```twilio``` using pip.

Nomorobo is a scam call lookup service, if it returns ```TRUE``` then the number is a robocaller/scam.
